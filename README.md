# My first Programs in java

There are some of my first programs (after "Hello World") in java, for learn how can i use language.

In this repository, you'll find all the projects I've created in Java from books.

Here I learn how to use Graphical User Interfaces, some data structures, network communication and the Spring Boot java framework.

 *All this to learn how to use this programming language.*
